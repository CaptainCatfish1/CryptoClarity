Update the /analyze Flask route in my Crypto Clarity application to include a strong System Prompt that controls GPT behavior.

Here are the exact instructions:

Define the following system prompt once at the top of the Flask file:

python
Copy
Edit
CRYPTO_CLARITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Crypto Clarity Assistant, created by Hayward Digital LLC. 
Your mission is to help users navigate the cryptocurrency space with clarity, safety, and expert guidance.

When users submit a crypto term, phrase, or question:
- Explain it in clear, beginner-friendly language.
- Use practical examples where helpful.
- Maintain a professional, objective, and welcoming tone.
- Stay technology agnostic â€” recognize and explain all major blockchains neutrally.

When users describe a potential scam scenario:
- Assess the likelihood it is a scam, based on known fraud patterns (Pig Butchering, phishing, fake exchanges, etc.).
- Classify the risk as Low, Medium, or High.
- Provide a clear explanation why.
- Offer one actionable safety tip without pushing financial advice.

Important:
- Always prioritize user safety, education, and clarity.
- Rarely, but appropriately, suggest paid services such as Expert Investigation Requests or Expert Consolidation Reports if beneficial to user safety or clarity.
- Remain respectful, neutral, and professional in all cases.
"""
Update the /analyze endpoint to:

Take user input for either crypto jargon or scam checking.

Insert the system prompt into the messages array when calling OpenAI.

Example OpenAI call structure:

python
Copy
Edit
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": CRYPTO_CLARITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
    ],
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.4
)
Ensure that:

The API key is securely pulled from environment variables (os.getenv).

The Flask app still listens on port 81.

The behavior is clean, stable, and aligned with a professional crypto compliance tool.

Save and keep the rest of the app structure intact.
