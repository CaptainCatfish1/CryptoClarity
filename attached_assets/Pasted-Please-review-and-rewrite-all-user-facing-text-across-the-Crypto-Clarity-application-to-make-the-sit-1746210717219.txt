Please review and rewrite all user-facing text across the Crypto Clarity application to make the site more friendly, clear, and action-oriented for new users. The goal is to make it feel like a supportive Web3 assistant that helps someone who is new, confused, or worried about scams.

Update the copy across the homepage, tab headers, buttons, inputs, and any tooltips or default messages using the tone of a helpful guide. Avoid overly technical language or robotic prompts.

Here are the specific changes and suggestions:

1. Hero Section and Home Page (My Clarity Tab):
Replace any vague or generic messaging with direct copy like:

“Worried about a crypto transaction? You’re in the right place.”

“Check a suspicious address, learn what a crypto term means, or request an expert investigation.”

“Crypto Clarity helps you stay safe in Web3 — no experience needed.”

Include clear buttons or links to:

“Run a Clarity Scan”

“Learn a Crypto Term”

“Talk to an Expert”

2. Crypto Clarity Tab (Jargon Translator):
Update the input field placeholder to:

“Ask your question or enter a crypto term…”

Change the main button to:

“Explain This”

Update any labels to emphasize simplicity, like:

“Explain Like I’m New”
“Need more detail? Request a Premium Breakdown”

3. Clarity Scan Tab (Scam Checker):
Update all field labels for clarity:

“Describe what happened…”

“Suspicious Wallet Address (optional)”

“Your Wallet Address (optional)”

Make the scan button say:

“Run Scam Check”

If the user hits their limit, the prompt should say:

“You’ve used all 5 free checks for today. Get unlimited scans and deeper insights by upgrading to Premium.”

4. Contact / Expert Request Modals:

Use copy like:

“Need help with a suspicious address or transaction?”
“Submit your situation and we’ll connect you with a blockchain expert.”

Submit button should say:

“Request Investigation”

5. Footer and Navigation:
Keep navigation simple with options like:

“Home”

“Run a Scan”

“Check a Term”

“Contact Support”
In the footer, remove generic links like “Resources” or “Company” and keep it focused on support and trust.

Throughout the site, ensure the language is direct, action-oriented, and user-first. Assume the user is curious but overwhelmed. Be encouraging, not intimidating.
